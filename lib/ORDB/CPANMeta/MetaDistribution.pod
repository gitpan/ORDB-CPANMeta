=head1 METHODS

=head2 select

  # Get all objects in list context
  my @list = ORDB::CPANMeta::MetaDistribution->select;
  
  # Get a subset of objects in scalar context
  my $array_ref = ORDB::CPANMeta::MetaDistribution->select(
      'where  > ? order by ',
      1000,
  );

The C<select> method executes a typical SQL C<SELECT> query on the
meta_distribution table.

It takes an optional argument of a SQL phrase to be added after the
C<FROM meta_distribution> section of the query, followed by variables
to be bound to the placeholders in the SQL phrase. Any SQL that is
compatible with SQLite can be used in the parameter.

Returns a list of B<ORDB::CPANMeta::MetaDistribution> objects when called in list context, or a
reference to an ARRAY of B<ORDB::CPANMeta::MetaDistribution> objects when called in scalar context.

Throws an exception on error, typically directly from the L<DBI> layer.

=head2 count

  # How many objects are in the table
  my $rows = ORDB::CPANMeta::MetaDistribution->count;
  
  # How many objects 
  my $small = ORDB::CPANMeta::MetaDistribution->count(
      'where  > ?',
      1000,
  );

The C<count> method executes a C<SELECT COUNT(*)> query on the
meta_distribution table.

It takes an optional argument of a SQL phrase to be added after the
C<FROM meta_distribution> section of the query, followed by variables
to be bound to the placeholders in the SQL phrase. Any SQL that is
compatible with SQLite can be used in the parameter.

Returns the number of objects that match the condition.

Throws an exception on error, typically directly from the L<DBI> layer.
